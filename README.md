# Py_Bot
Discord Chat bot inspired by watching how useful other chat bots have been on our community server. Curiousity got the best of me so I began researching what it took to build a bot. Wanting to find any excuse to work more with python. I killed two birds with one stone and made a chat bot with some fun functionality/interactions with web APIs.
